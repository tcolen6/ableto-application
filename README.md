In this challenge, I decided to minimize the UI to make the code easier and plainer to read. Everything besides index.php is just a template. See db.txt for the database implementation. Everything in the database is pretty straightforward. Note there are some users already in the system with some data. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for considering my application!
